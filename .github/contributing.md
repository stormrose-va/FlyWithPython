## Contributing to FlyWithPython

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to FlyWithPython, which
is hosted in the [Stormrose Organization](https://github.com/stormrose-va/) on
GitHub. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel
free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

#### Reporting Issues

One important contribution you can do without coding knowledge is reporting
issues you detected during your daily usage of FlyWithPython. Generally, an
issue can be either a defect (i. e. FlyWithPython does not work as documented),
a change request (e. g. propose a new feature that would ease your life as
FlyWithPython user), or a request for support or clarification (e. g.
where the FlyWithPython documentation is not plain and explicit).

Issues can be reported through our
[tracker](https://github.com/stormrose-va/FlyWithPython/issues) on GitHub.
Before filling the form and pressing on send, please take a few seconds and

* ensure the issue was not reported before by searching the
  [tracker](https://github.com/stormrose-va/FlyWithPython/issues).
  Dealing with duplicate reports is a dull, administrative work that consumes
  our time and reduces our capacity to work on fixes or new features, so
  performing this quick search is for your own good :wink:
* check you have all the relevant information to fill in the
  [issue template](https://github.com/stormrose-va/FlyWithPython/blob/master/.github/issue_template.md) as accurately as possible. Querying you for additional information takes time
  (ours and yours) and slows down resolution of the issue, so being as
  comprehensive as possible is a good deal for all involved parties :+1:
* take a quick look at our
  [documentation on issue management](https://flywithpython.readthedocs.io/internals/issues.html).
  It's not that long to read, but
  should give you a basic understanding of issue labels and how we work with
  issues :rocket:

#### Contributing Documentation

Writing documentation is always a tedious job for developers. We did our best to
facilitate documenting FlyWithPython by setting up a mostly automated build and
deploy system for the documentation. However, you're more than welcome if you
want to improve the documentation in any which way (mind, not all developers
are English native speakers...).

We have a defined process in place for updating everything related to
FlyWithPython, and that includes the documentation. Please have a look at this
process in the
[Project Documentation](https://flywithpython.readthedocs.io/).

#### Contributing Code

If you want to support us by contributing to the code works, please familiarize
with the
[Project Documentation](https://flywithpython.readthedocs.io/).
This is a key resource to understand FlyWithPython's development process and
governance.

#### Contact

GitHub does not provide direct means of contacting the development team or
members of it, but there's a marvellous issue tracker that might help you around
that: If you want to get in touch to discuss ways of contributing, the
recommended way is to
[create an issue](https://github.com/stormrose-va/FlyWithPython/issues/new)
and assign the `team` label to it. We will then come back to you; just grant us
a bit of time - FlyWithPython is developed by volunteers in their free time, so
we might not be able to police the issue tracker on a daily basis.
